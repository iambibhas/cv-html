                I've been a developer for about 11 years now. Mostly web dev, but played around with Arduino to Ansible. Happy to try and learn new things as and when necessary. Most of the code I've ever written throughout my career is on Github. I helped organize PyCon India for 4 years. And I was one of the first Duckduckgo community leaders in India.
